//! Blockchain backends
//!
//! This module provides the implementation of a few commonly-used backends like
//! [Electrum](crate::blockchain::electrum), [Esplora](crate::blockchain::esplora) and
//! [Compact Filters/Neutrino](crate::blockchain::compact_filters), along with two generalized
//! traits [`Blockchain`] and [`OnlineBlockchain`] that can be implemented to build customized
//! backends.
//!
//! Types that only implement the [`Blockchain`] trait can be used as backends for [`Wallet`](crate::wallet::Wallet)s, but any
//! action that requires interacting with the blockchain won't be available ([`Wallet::sync`](crate::wallet::Wallet::sync) and
//! [`Wallet::broadcast`](crate::wallet::Wallet::broadcast)). This allows the creation of physically air-gapped wallets, that have no
//! ability to contact the outside world. An example of an offline-only client is [`OfflineBlockchain`].
//!
//! Types that also implement [`OnlineBlockchain`] will make the two aforementioned actions
//! available.
